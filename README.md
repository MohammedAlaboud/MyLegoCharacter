# MyLegoCharacter
Modelled, texture painted, rigged, and animated my own Lego Character in Blender.

A small issue was discovered when animating the charcter. A vertex on one of the wrists was being stretched when moving the character, and it is believed that it was due to how the character was rigged. 

Below is a screenshot of the final model:
